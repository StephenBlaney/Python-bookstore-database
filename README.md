# Python-bookstore-database
Real world program that allows the user to store information about books,
This was built mainly with tkinter which is a graphical user interface library for python and the
SQLite3 library to interact with SQLite database. The user has the choice of selecting all books within 
the database system, make an addition, a deletion or edit a specific field. Good Exercise for GUI datebase interaction with 
Python.
